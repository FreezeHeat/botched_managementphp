# Manage clients and their requests - using PHP + PHP framework 'CodeIgniter'.

Read the notes.txt for installing it on your codeigniter framework.

This is a botched project, for the sake of privacy I will not state for whom.

Features:

The form.php page allow clients to state their requests and send it to the business.
the manage.php page allows to manage the clients' requests.

The form page job options are brought straight from the database, and more can be added through the manage.php page.

the manage page allows the management to edit and delete request, as well as add new job options to the form.php page,
editing information can be done by double clicking a table cell.
When you finish editing, select all table rows that were changed and apply.
